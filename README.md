## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There's no need to install any libraries to run this code on the Anaconda environment.
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, the main goal is to do an exploratory data analysis on some transaction data and to better understand:

1. What kind of transactions do the users mostly do?
2. Do these transactions bring profit?
3. How is the number of transactions behaving over time?
4. Is the number of transactions related to the number of new users?
5. When would be the least chaotic day of the week and time to take down the server to do a maintanence job on the database?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The analysis here was divided into 3 notebooks with their respective questions and demonstration of the analysis that led to the answer.
They are divided this way for easier readability:

transactions_Q1.ipynb
transactions_Q2.ipynb
transactions_Q3.ipynb

There's also a csv file with the dataset used on the notebooks.



## Results<a name="results"></a>

Each notebook brings the answers to the proposed questions.
A blog post format of the finding is available [here] 

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinavillaschi/).
